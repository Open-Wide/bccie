PLATFORM SPECIFIC NOTES:

This solution supports content export in UTF8 by default.

If you wish to export content using another format, please create an export format output handler and use it via ini settings.

Alternatively if you do not wish to create an export format output handler than you can convert the export file yourself manually via some other means.
